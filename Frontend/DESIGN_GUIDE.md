# ClaimDoo Design Implementation Guide

## 🎨 Authentication Pages Design Notes

Based on the provided mockup, here's how the authentication pages are implemented:

### Sign Up Page (Company Registration)
✅ **Implemented Features:**
- Name field
- Email field
- Password field with show/hide toggle
- Confirm Password field
- **Country Selection Dropdown** (with flags and currency info)
  - When country is selected, the currency is automatically set as company's base currency
  - 190+ countries available
  - Each country shows flag emoji and currency code
- "Signup" button
- Link to Sign In page

### Sign In Page
✅ **Implemented Features:**
- Email field
- Password field with show/hide toggle
- "Login" button
- "Don't have an account? Signup" link

## 🌍 Country & Currency System

### How It Works:
1. **User selects country** from dropdown on signup
2. **System automatically sets** company's base currency based on selected country
3. **Currency is stored** in company profile
4. **All expenses** are converted to this base currency for reporting

### Countries Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  name: "United States",
  code: "US",
  currency: "USD",
  currencySymbol: "$",
  flag: "🇺🇸"
}
```

### Example Implementation:
When user selects "United States":
- Company base currency → USD ($)
- All dashboard amounts shown in USD
- Currency conversion available for international expenses

- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus visible states
- Error announcements

### 3. Performance:
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimized images and icons
- Minimal bundle size
- Fast initial load

### 4. Security:
- Password visibility toggle (not storing in plain text in real app)
- CSRF protection ready
- Input sanitization
- Secure session management

## 🔄 State Management

### Authentication Context:
```javascript
{
  user: { name, email, role },
  company: { name, currency, country },
  isAuthenticated: boolean,
  signIn: (credentials) => {},
  signUp: (data) => {},
  signOut: () => {}
}
```

### Form State:
